The bloc, for financial and strategic reasons, wants to build strong economic ties with Beijing that bolster Brussels' desire to be a serious player on the world stage as the leading light of Western values.The problem is, doing so in any serious way means turning a blind eye to China's well-documented human rights violations.For much of the past decade, the world's largest trading bloc has gone out of its way to establish an economic partnership with Beijing that doesn't conflict too aggressively with Brussels' lofty values. The EU was criticized from both in and outside the bloc when it announced last December the conclusion in principle of negotiations with the Chinese government on its \\\"Comprehensive Agreement on Investment\\\" (CAI).  According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the agreement, if ratified, \\\"will provide unprecedented access to the Chinese market,\\\" while also committing \\\"China to ambitious principles on sustainability, transparency and non-discrimination.\\\" Any agreement like this needs to be approved by the EU's 27 member states and ratified by the European parliament.  Read MorePrecisely how bound China would be to any of the EU's redlines was an immediate cause for concern. \\\"The deal makes statements about human rights and forced labor, but there is no way of forcing China to do anything,\\\" says Samira Rafaela, a member of the EU parliament who sits on the international trade committee.Queen Elizabeth visits UK's largest warship, as it set sails for South China SeaMany of Rafaela's colleagues across the political spectrum clearly agree. Last week, the parliament voted on a motion to freeze the CAI until further notice. Ostensibly, this was in protest at China placing sanctions on five MEPs who had criticized China's treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang among other things.  However, in reality the sanctions were really the final straw for some who couldn't stomach Brussels striking a friendly deal with a government in Beijing that allegedly imprisons people in forced labor camps, undermines democracy in Hong Kong and is increasingly hostile in its own region.  \\\"The statement we are sending with this motion isn't simply, if China lifts the sanctions then CAI is back on the table,\\\" says Reinhard B\\u00fctikofer, chair of the parliament's delegation on China relations. \\\"If sanctions are lifted, we will look at the detail, but it's currently far from satisfactory. It's weak on forced labor, weak on sustainability, weak on dispute resolutions. These problems will still exist even if we resurrect the agreement.\\\"  Given the chances of China lifting these sanctions any time soon is virtually zero, this creates a problem for the top brass in the EU Commission, who have invested a lot of political capital in the deal.   For the EU's increasingly political executive branch, China formed a key part of its plan to become a bigger player on the global stage and become diplomatically independent of its most important ally: the United States. \\\"Strategic autonomy,\\\" as Brussels calls it, has been a priority for EU officials who are concerned about Europe's inherent vulnerabilities, be they from Russian aggression in the east, over-reliance on China for medical supplies or the risk of another president like Donald Trump pulling American troops out of Europe.  \\\"The China agreement was a big plank in that strategy,\\\" says Steven Blockmans, director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies. \\\"If the Chinese and European parliament don't move, the EU risks losing a deal that would have cemented the idea it can make decisions to defend its own commercial interests, without having to call the White House first.\\\" Despite the European parliament's protests, the commission still thinks the deal is right for the EU. Officials who spoke with CNN explained that they understood the parliament's concerns and that the political conditions didn't exist at the moment. One official even lauded the parliament's action, saying it provided proof that \\\"economic interests will not prevent the EU from standing up for human rights.\\\" However, they also said this was a rare window of opportunity to get China committing to something on paper, and that window could run out for political reasons -- most notably after upcoming elections in France and Germany, the two member states most supportive of the deal.  It's at member state level that the apparent split between parliament and commission gets interesting. It's been known for some time that locking in some kind of formal relationship with China was a big priority for Angela Merkel as she tries to nail down her legacy. The German Chancellor will stand down after 16 years in power this autumn, as Germany holds federal elections.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (R) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a joint news conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on May 24, 2018. As things stand, it's likely that Merkel's party -- no longer with a leader who holds as much political capital as her -- will have to enter a coalition with the anti-Beijing Greens. This could significantly soften German support for the deal.  The other key sponsor of the deal was French President Emmanuel Macron, a man who also faces re-election next year. The fact that Macron's biggest rival is far-right Marine Le Pen has led some to think he might, in the coming months, cool on globalist policies.  As for the other member states, diplomats who spoke to CNN pointed out that the CAI is not a full trade deal and that there was no urgent need to rush anything through. As one diplomat put it, \\\"there is an awakening in Europe about the real character of its relationship with China and governments don't like it. This will be parked for a while is my guess.\\\" The commission remains convinced that its political capital was well spent and that member states will ultimately choose their economies over other priorities. \\\"Even if leadership changes, the economic reality in Germany and France isn't going to change, and economics has a habit of trumping other concerns,\\\" the diplomat said.   Philippe Lamberts, a senior Belgian MEP, disagrees: \\\"I think EU-China relations are going to get worse before they get better. Even if they lift their sanctions, what message does it send on European values if we agree a deal with such weak provisions on human rights, democracy and sustainability?\\\"  The EU's record on human rights, critics argue, is already patchy. While last week the European parliament did stand up to both China and Turkey -- calling for the suspension of talks with Ankara to join the bloc over its own human rights record -- campaigners say that the EU is not doing enough to uphold its own standards on human records inside or outside the bloc.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and French Emmanuel Macron (taste wine as they visit France's pavilion during the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on November 5, 2019.\\\"Trade and investment are an area where economic interests have always prevailed over respect for human rights, as much as security concerns have always prevailed in migration management,\\\" says Elena Crespi, program officer for Western Europe at the International Federation for Human Rights.  And while the parliament has a good track record on human rights, awarding its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to an imprisoned Uyghur scholar in 2019, critics believe the commission falls short in comparison.  \\\"The current commission is not sufficiently doing its job in upholding European values,\\\" says Alice Stollmeyer, executive director of Defend Democracy. \\\"Whether it's fudging on rule of law in Hungary and Poland or failing to properly speak out against atrocities elsewhere, the EU sadly seems to have a policy of appeasement for abusers.\\\" It's no secret that the EU is in a transitional phase. Those at the center of the project see a future of closer union and its officials in Brussels becoming serious players on the world stage in their own right.  If a balanced relationship with China was indeed central to this, the current mood among elected politicians across the member states will be of serious concern to the Brussels elite.  Perhaps more worrying, Blockmans points out, is whether China reassesses how much it wants a deal with the bloc. \\\"It might be that China still sees the EU as a secondary player -- a lackey to the US. If that's that case, they might decide that this is a deal worth collapsing for their own political ends.\\\"  Regardless, the point is moot while Europe's political class refuses to even look at this deal. The longer this deadlock on sanctions goes on, the greater the chance it totally collapses. And it if does, those at the top table in Brussels might regret investing so much political capital in dealing with one of the world's worst human rights offenders.  \",\n          \" (CNN)Senegal and Liverpool football star Sadio Mane has donated $693,000 (\\u00a3500,000) to help fund the construction of a hospital in his hometown of Bambali in Senegal.

The biggest similarity was the high number of named storms. The 2021 season became only the third in history to use all of the names on the rotating seasonal list (the previous years were 2020 and 2005).We ended the season with 21 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). During an average year there would be 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. This year met or exceeded each of those categories, and it was forecast to be that way. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30.There were four major hurricanes this season: Grace, Ida, Larry, and Sam. The strongest two were Ida and Sam, which both reached Category 4 strength. Grace and Larry peaked as Category 3 storms. The first half of the season was off to the races -- as the US was impacted by eight named storms: Claudette, Danny, Elsa, Fred, Henri, Ida, Mindy, and Nicholas.Read MoreThen, suddenly, the world's oceans became eerily quiet. After September 25 the Atlantic and the rest of the world would struggle to produce a named storm.That was not what meteorologists expected.\\\"The globe has had no major (Category 3+, max winds >=111 mph) hurricane/typhoon/cyclone formations since September 25. All other hurricane seasons in the satellite era (since 1966) have had at least two global major hurricane formations between September 26 - November 19,\\\" Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University, said in a tweet.  Both last year and this year La Ni\\u00f1a conditions were observed during the last several weeks of the season, which typically favors late season tropical activity. 2020 saw three named storms in November (Eta, Theta, and Iota) and 2021 saw just one (Wanda) during the first few days.How this hurricane season ended marks one of the biggest differences between this year and last.Klotzbach explained that usually La Ni\\u00f1a weakens or limits vertical wind shear, but surprisingly there was quite elevated wind shear in the Caribbean in October and November -- the focal region for storms late in the season -- and that led to a quiet latter part of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.NOAA predicts 6th consecutive above-average hurricane seasonWhile an active season was predicted, it's impossible to know in advance exactly where each storm will go and what kind of damage it may cause. A \\\"bad\\\" season is all about perspective. Central American countries may consider this to have been a \\\"good\\\" year since not a single named storm hit any part of the region. In 2020, Central America was hit by three named storms, two of which were major hurricanes. In the US, the state of Louisiana can't seem to catch a break. In 2020, the Pelican State was impacted by five named storms: Cristobal, Laura, Marco, Delta and Zeta. This year the state was impacted by three named storms: Claudette, Ida and Nicholas.In 2020 more hurricanes made landfall in the US, but this year the storms cost over $20 billion more. Billions in damageWhile only one major hurricane made landfall across the US (Ida), a total of four named storms left behind over $1 billion in damage each: Tropical Storm Elsa, Tropical Storm Fred, Hurricane Ida, and Hurricane Nicholas.Ida alone exceeded the cost in damage of all seven billion-dollar tropical cyclones that made landfall across the US in 2020, including hurricanes like Laura, Delta, and Zeta.\\\"To date, Hurricane Ida is the costliest disaster this year -- exceeding $60 billion,\\\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \\\"Ida already ranks among the top-five most costly hurricanes on record for the US since 1980.\\\"JUST WATCHEDThis Louisiana family lost their mom in Hurricane Ida.

At least 55 people died across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.This season's quirksThe strongest storm of the season didn't hit land but video was captured from inside it.Hurricane Sam, like Ida, also reached Category 4 strength with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph. Sam remained a Category 4 hurricane for 4.5 days and generated the fifth-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) recorded in the satellite era.\\\"ACE is integrated metric accounting for storm intensity and duration,\\\" Klotzbach tweeted. \\\"Sam was a long-lived, intense hurricane.\\\"Fortunately, unlike Ida, Sam remained out over the open waters of the Atlantic and never made landfall.Sam's long life, of over 11 days as a hurricane, allowed a research drone to be sailed into it, and, for the first time, to transmit video from inside a major hurricane at ocean level.JUST WATCHEDWatch how Hurricane Sam was filmed like never beforeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch how Hurricane Sam was filmed like never before 02:27A couple of other storms made some meteorological records.Tropical Storm Ana formed in a unique area of the Atlantic Ocean. In the last 100 years, no named storm had ever developed east of Bermuda in the month of May. Tropical Storm Ana broke that record. Typically, storms during this month form over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, western Caribbean Sea and near the southeastern US coast.Another unique storm was Subtropical Storm Teresa. Reports of subtropical storms are not uncommon, especially in the 21st century, thanks to advanced technology. What is uncommon is for a storm to remain subtropical for its entire life, never transitioning to \\\"tropical\\\" status. Teresa was also extremely short-lived, at only 24 hours. Subtropical Storm Teresa formed on Friday, September 24, at 5 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time. Exactly 24 hours later, the NHC issued its final advisory as Teresa became a remnant, low-pressure system. Ida will likely be the only name on the retired list this year, despite there being three other major hurricanes, simply because of the amount of damage and fatalities caused. The letter \\\"I\\\" already has more retired names than any other letter in the alphabet. There are already 12 retired storm names that start with the letter \\\"I\\\", and Ida will likely become the 13th.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            " (Reuters)Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton played down his chances of starting the Formula One season with a win and said on Saturday his Mercedes lacked a 'considerable amount' of pace.The season begins in Bahrain next week and Hamilton, hoping to win back the title from Red Bull's Max Verstappen after a controversial end to the 2021 season, took the underdog position.\"At the moment, I'm sure everyone can figure that out, we are not the quickest,\" the 37-year-old Briton told reporters on the final day of pre-season testing at the Sakhir circuit.\"I think Ferrari look to be the quickest and perhaps Red Bull and then maybe us or McLaren. We're currently not at the top.\"Asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to fight for the championship, Hamilton said it was too early and expressed confidence in his team's proven ability to work through any problems.F1 world champion Max Verstappen signs new deal with Red Bull Racing until 2028Read MoreMercedes have won the last eight constructors' championships.Hamilton said the new car had shown decent reliability and the team had got through their test programme but it was clear there remained much to do.\"At the moment I don't think we'll be competing for wins,\" he said.\"There is potential within our car to get us there, we've just got to learn to be able to extract it... we have some hurdles to overcome.\"Next week we'll get a much better showing of our pace but I think people will be surprised, maybe. People keep talking about (whether) we're talking ourselves down or not but it's a bit different this year.\"Mercedes's rivals have taken such declarations with some scepticism in the past.Last year Mercedes had a troubled pre-season, completing the fewest laps of any team, but Hamilton still won the opening race in Bahrain.Max Verstappen wins first F1 world title after dramatic Abu Dhabi Grand Prix endingIn 2019, Mercedes had looked up to half a second off Ferrari's pace in testing and then finished one-two in Melbourne.This season has radically revised rules and Hamilton, the sport's most successful driver of all time with a record 103 wins, said it felt different.\"I think we have far bigger challenges this time,\" he said. \"It will take a little bit longer. From what I'm told, we have a considerable amount of pace to find.\"AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly, who followed the Mercedes closely on Saturday and observed Hamilton's struggles with the car, was prepared to agree.\"I think they do have some work to be fighting right at the top, but it's only testing,\" said the Frenchman.\n"
